UWA Research Infrastructure Centres Site Registration Application
================================================================
The intent of this system is to record and monitor the visits of guests and 
contractors so that **site managers** can have a grasp of who is on site, their 
contact details, their intended length of stay and the ability to receive 
notifications upon the arrival of new **visitors**. Additionally, through 
recording these visits alongside additional visiting and registration 
information provide reasonably accurate diagnostics for reporting purposes.
